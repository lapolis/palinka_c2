## The usual ToDo file that only the 0.5%* of people really care about
__(*)I am not part of that 0.5% - This stuff might never be done__

The list:
- <del>check listener alive on init</del>
- <del>check duplicate listener name and port already in use</del>
- Listener info preview
- Parse HTTPS endpoints from config file
- SSL
- debug log in logger - write to file
- Auto-Generate (at least) powershell code
- stream file by splitting it (like a real C2)
- check reuse of listeners or bring them up if still alive
- PornHub c2 w/ postcard call back
- <del>Tabbed main menu</del>
- <del>different menu</del>
- pwn stuff
