# palinka_c2 v0.1
Why am I doing this? Cause I recently started usign CobaltStrike for red team operations but I still define as "magic" most of the things that it does. So, this is my way to understand things.
I decided to start this things after I saw this [article](https://0xrick.github.io/misc/c2/), so yeah, thanks 0xRick!
